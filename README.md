## Code Puzzle

### The Evaluation

We will review your submission based on the following criteria (in no particular order):

* The ability to follow instructions
* Quality of code submission
* Adherance to best practices
* Clarity of documentation

### Best Available Seat

Write a REST API to return the best available seat (closest to the front & middle) given a list of open seats. Rows follow alphabetical order with `A` being the first row. Columns follow numerical order from left to right (starting with `1`).

The list of open seats, number of rows and columns (seats) should be configurable and based on a JSON input.

```json
{
    "venue": {
        "layout": {
            "rows": 10,
            "columns": 50
        }
    },
    "seats": {
        "a1": {
            "id": "a1",
            "row": "a",
            "column": 1,
            "status": "AVAILABLE"
        },
        "b5": {
            "id": "b5",
            "row": "b",
            "column": 5,
            "status": "AVAILABLE"
        },
        "h7": {
            "id": "h7",
            "row": "h",
            "column": 7,
            "status": "AVAILABLE"
        }
    }
}
```

The solution should find the best open seat  (closest to the front & middle) given the input JSON and number of requested seats. Imagine a concert, people want to be as close as possible to the stage. To keep things simple, any seat in a closer row will always be preferred to a seat in a further row.

For example, for a `venue` with `10 rows` and `12 columns` with all seats open, the best seat would be either `A6` or `A7`.

If a group of seats is requested, the algorithm needs to find the best open group of seats together. In the example above, for `3 seats`, it would be `A5`, `A6`, and `A7`.

For `5 columns` and `2 requested seats` the best open seats - assuming the first row `A` is fully occupied and the second row `B` is fully open, would be `B2` and `B3`.

All results should be returned as JSON.

Additional Requirements: 

* The app should have automated tests
* The app needs a `README.md` explaining the app and steps to run it locally
* Your submission should be in a private Github repo

### Technology

Use whatever set of technologies that you are comfortable with. This is meant to be a demonstration of your problem solving ability - it's not a test of how well you know a particular programming language. 

### Extra Credit

If you are interested, try improving the solution by adding one or more of the following:

* Expand the algorithm so that a user can request multiple seats (together)
* Web app that shows a seat view and shows the best available seats based on the requested number of seats
